This is a project that started as an entry to a competition a local consultancy company hosted during my university studies.
Version 1 of the project is the version I entered with and ending up winning the competition, which gave me some money to develop version 2.

The hardware for version 2 and a working base for the software was developed but after some time struggling to implement a GUI on my own [Simple GUI](https://github.com/hampussandberg/HexConnect/wiki/Simple-GUI) the project was abandoned...
I still have all the components and it is still working as I left it so I might start working on it again in the future.


## Ideas to startup the project again
- Replace the UI processor with Raspberry Pi compute module and use Qt for the GUI
- Replace the LCD with something that is easier to buy and with touch over USB
